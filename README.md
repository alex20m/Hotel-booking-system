# Y2_2023_07666_Reservation_System

## Checkpoint1 

## Current properties

At this point everything but the UI is almost implemented. There will almost surely be some small changes, but for now
the program can read previous files (reservations) and writes new reservations to the files. The reservation making
part of the program is also working, which means the program knows if a room is available or not, and if available, 
makes a reservation.


## Instructions

It is possible to run the program from the test functions.

When the program starts it always starts with reading the files and saving the previous reservations in lists or
dictionaries. When a reservation is successfully made it is being written into the files. The program has
one file with all of the hotels reservations written with all the necessary info.

## Schedule

I have spent about 10-15 hours making the project so far. I have not made any changes to my schedule.

## Other

I have not had any specific problems. My plan has change a bit, but it's mostly the UML plan that has changed. New functions
have been added and some have been removed or moved to another class.
