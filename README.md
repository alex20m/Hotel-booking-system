# Y2_2023_07666_Reservation_System

## Checkpoint2

## Current properties

The program is now fully working with almost all of the implementations that I planned to implement. The GUI
 is also working and is designed in a way that looks good and easy to use for the user. The only feature 
left to implement is the unique part of the program, which will either be an option to remove a booking or 
a search bar so the user can search for a specific resevration after printing all of a guest/hotels reservations.
The program can take reservations and can also print all of a guests reservations or all of the hotels reservations
within a time interval.


## Instructions

It is possible to run the program from the main function and the program and GUI is fully functional.

When the program starts it always starts with reading the files and saving the previous reservations in lists or
dictionaries. When a reservation is successfully made it is being written into the files and into the dictionary. 
The program has one file with all of the hotels reservations written with all the necessary info.

## Schedule

I am not sure how many hours I have spent on the project altogether but maybe about 30 hours so far. 
I have not made any changes to the schedule of my project plan.
## Other

I have not had any specific problems, although I had some problems with getting the calendar to work like I wanted
it to. My plan has change a bit, but it's mostly the UML plan that has changed. New functions have been added and 
some have been removed or moved to another class.
